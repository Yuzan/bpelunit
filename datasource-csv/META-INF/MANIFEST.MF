Bundle-Description: BPEL has become the defacto standard language for co
 mposing Web services. However, as every other programming language deve
 lopers can introduce defects into the code that can lead to undesired c
 onsequences when the software is rolled out at the client-side. Therefo
 re, all software development methodologies include testing as one of th
 e important activities. For nearly every programming language, a unit t
 esting framework exists, for example JUnit for Java. These testing fram
 eworks allow developers to easily test small chunks of the code that th
 ey have written. Until recently, BPEL lacked such support. However, BPE
 LUnit was developed for closing this gap.
